This is the mechanical design of a robot with a moving head and with a moving penis
It was a very nice birthday present :)
It uses a raspberry pi 4, the RPI WWCAM for the head, and 2 servos.

Remarks and improvements:
On top make the space for the camera connection band a little larger.
Add an external USB card and an internal speaker. If not. use a bluetooth camera and it will do the job.
Do not use the onboard sound card because that one it is used for controlling the servos.

Conclusion:
It is a funny toy!
